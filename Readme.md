This is a git repo with a readme and some text files. The text files are actually mark down files, and so is the readme. All normal readme files in git are mark down I think. Anyway here's a quote or something:

>I've seen things you people wouldn't believe... 
>Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion... 
>I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the 
>TannhÃ¤user Gate. All those moments will be 
>lost in time, like tears in rain... Time to die[^1]
